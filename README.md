# Spaceship Game
This is a simple game in which you control a spaceship, and you must clear asteroids and destroy enemy ships to earn points. 
The more points you earn, the more the difficulty increases. Survive as long as possible!

## Flocking
This game uses a flocking algorithm to control the enemy movements. Their movement is heavily weighted towards following and facing the player, however, flocking is used to ensure they move
seamlessly as a group.
